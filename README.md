## 📖 Overview

Recent measurement studies show that the fastest CDN paths are not always those with the lowest round-trip time (RTT). Factors like congestion, cache load, and routing policies can degrade throughput even with low latency.

This project investigates how clients can make better CDN server choices by combining RTT with **Time to First Byte (TTFB)** and **packet loss** — resulting in a lightweight, interpretable selection metric.

> **Goal:** Demonstrate that a simple multi-metric approach can improve median and tail throughput compared to RTT-only selection.

## 🧪 Methods

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**  
   - 100–500 samples simulating CDN metrics (RTT, TTFB, loss, throughput).

2. **Real Dataset Analysis**  
   - RIPE Atlas: global ping/loss measurements.  
   - M-Lab: throughput and latency data across regions.

3. **Metric Design**  
   - Composite score:  
     \[
     Score = α(1/RTT) + β(1/TTFB) - γ(Loss)
     \]
   - Evaluate against baseline RTT-only selection.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Median and 90th percentile throughput improvements.
